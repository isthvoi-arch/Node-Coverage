## <span style="color:#2563EB;">Overview</span>

Node-Coverage is a documentation and configuration repository focused on optimizing scooter distribution and coverage across operational areas. Each node represents a drop location or cluster where scooters can be deployed. The repository supports data-driven decisions on where to add, adjust, or remove nodes to improve availability, utilization, and overall service efficiency.

## <span style="color:#16A34A;">Purpose</span>

The purpose of this repository is to centralize methodologies, configuration logic, and best practices for managing and optimizing drop locations across the map. The goal is to ensure balanced coverage, minimize idle scooters, and enhance rider accessibility.

## <span style="color:#DB2777;">Contents</span>

This repository may include:

- Procedures for adding or adjusting drop nodes
- Guidelines for optimizing node density and capacity
- Documentation on data inputs, map layers, and operational parameters
- Future materials on automation, simulation, and predictive modeling

## <span style="color:#7C3AED;">Usage</span>

Use this repository as a reference when planning or modifying node coverage. It provides context for operational decisions, configuration standards, and optimization strategies across different city zones.

## <span style="color:#DC2626;">Future Scope</span>

- Integrate demand forecasting and heatmap analytics
- Automate node adjustment workflows
- Expand documentation for new markets and operational models
